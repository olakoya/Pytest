Docker
-------
platform ==> package our application with all its dependencies
package is a lightweight and portable container

Virtualization
---------------
Virtualization creates virtual machines (VMs) that simulate entire hardware environments.
It is very costly.
Analogy  â‡’  Imagine a hotel. Each VM is like a separate hotel room with its own amenities (like TV, bed, and bathroom). Every room is independent, but duplicating everything increases cost and size.

Containerization
----------------
Containerization runs applications in containers that share the host OS but remain isolated.
Low cost.
Analogy  â‡’ Think of a shipping container. Each container holds its own cargo (app and dependencies) but shares the ship (host OS) for transport.


Key Differences
----------------
Virtualisation ==> Multiple OS environemnts on one machine
Containerisation  ==> Multiple apps share one OS but run independently


Note
-----
Image ==> Containers

Images are present on Docker hub

All images are mostly linux images
