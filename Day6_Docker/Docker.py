Docker
-------
- This is a platform that helps to ==> package our application with all its dependencies
- This is a package that is lightweight and portable container

Virtualization
---------------
- Virtualization creates virtual machines (VMs) that simulate entire hardware environments.
- It is very costly.
- Analogy  ⇒  Imagine a hotel. Each VM is like a separate hotel room with its own amenities (like TV, bed, and bathroom).
- Every room is independent, but duplicating everything increases cost and size.

Containerization
----------------
Containerization runs applications in containers that share the host OS but remain isolated.
Low cost.
Analogy  ⇒ Think of a shipping container. Each container holds its own cargo (app and dependencies) but shares the ship
(host OS) for transport.


Key Differences
----------------
Virtualisation has ==> Multiple OS environments on one machine
Containerisation has ==> Multiple apps share one OS but run independently

We need Docker to work with Containerisation

Note: Every Container needs:
-----------------------------
1. An Image ==> Containers

2. Images are present on Docker Hub

3. All images are mostly linux images

4. All images are mostly linux images
